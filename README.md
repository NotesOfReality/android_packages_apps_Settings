# android_packages_apps_Settings
Various "Settings" app branches from various ROMs repos, with some personal modifications.I hope it can be a bit informative to anybody approaching to the "little world" of the modifications of the "Settings" app.
This is the "Settings" app "o8.1" repo from https://github.com/AICP/packages_apps_Settings/tree/o8.1 THANKS @AICP , I've uploaded it instead of forking in order to make search possible.

| Features I added: |
| :---------------------- |
| - "XiaomiParts" package/build module support ----> https://github.com/NotesOfReality/android_packages_apps_Settings/commit/5450c3518eccca1089db8f0f2b2134729dbcdef6 |
| - Custom "Ambient Display/Doze" package support ----> Look at all the commits made on the 24th of November 2018 |

At 99% percent it's other devs work, I'm too lazy to list them in credits, so if anybody feels anger towards me... Well I first beg your pardon, then give you all the credits you want :P :)
